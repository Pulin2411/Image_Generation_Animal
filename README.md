<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-screenshot-link.png" width="800" alt="Animals10 CNN Demo" />
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates image classification on the popular Animals-10 dataset
, which contains 10 categories of animals.

We build two models:

Baseline CNN → a simple convolutional model for quick experimentation.

Optimized CNN → a tuned model with additional layers, neurons, and dropout for improved accuracy.

The project compares baseline vs optimized CNN performance using training curves, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

🛠️ Features

End-to-end pipeline: dataset loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
